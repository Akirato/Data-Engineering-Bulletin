\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we propose a sentiment analysis method incorporating contextual information and external common sense knowledge for implicit sentiment analysis.
We first propose a retrieval method to extract valid sentiment triads from a knowledge base and build an adaptive fusion of external common sense knowledge embedding layers to extend the semantic information of implicit sentiment expressions.
Multi-polar attention mechanism is then used to learn embedding representations for implicit sentiment expressions, and an attention layer that incorporates context is introduced to mine and combine valid information in the context.
Finally, the common sense knowledge information provided by the external knowledge base is fused with the contextual representation and the semantic information of the sentiment expression itself to achieve an effective extension of the implicit sentiment sentence representation and to perform sentiment label prediction.
Experimental results on the SMP2019-ECISA dataset show that the method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and can fully exploit contextual information and external common sense knowledge to effectively improve the analysis of implicit sentiment expressions.
