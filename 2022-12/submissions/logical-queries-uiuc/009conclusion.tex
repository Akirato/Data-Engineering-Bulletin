In this paper, we present the problem definition and algorithms for knowledge graph comparative reasoning. 
Comparative reasoning aims to complement and expand the existing point-wise reasoning over knowledge graphs by inferring commonalities and inconsistencies of multiple pieces of clues.
We propose several methods to tackle comparative reasoning.
At the heart of the proposed methods are a suite of core algorithms, including predicate-predicate similarity and semantic subgraph matching for knowledge segment extraction; neural network and influence function, commonality rate, transferred information amount for both pairwise reasoning and collective reasoning. 
The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods (1) can effectively detect semantic inconsistency, and (2) scales near linearly with respect to the knowledge graph size.
