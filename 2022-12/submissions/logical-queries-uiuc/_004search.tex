%\subsubsection{Nibble on knowledge graph}

%Besides finding the most relevant entities w.r.t. the query entity, sometimes we may prefer to find a subgraph around the query entity. Compared with high similarity but disconnected entities, a connected subgraph may reveal more information about the entity. To achieve this goal, we generalize Nibble-PageRank ~\cite{nibble} to knowledge graph. 
%Nibble-PageRank is a local graph partitioning algorithm which is used to find dense cluster in the graph. 
%When generalize Nibble-PageRank to knowledge graph, we first transform the knowledge graph to a weighted graph according to the predicate entropy, then we use Nibble-PageRank to find the connected subgraph around the query entity.
