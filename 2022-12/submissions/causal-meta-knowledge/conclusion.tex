In this work, we propose a method, \dname, for entity-level link prediction based on the causal relationships between topologies at the concept level.
This method constructs complex connectivity between entities and predicts causal relationships between links at the conceptual level, eliminating spurious correlation that may be learned by traditional association-based methods.
Extensive experiments have shown that the proposed~\dname ~achieves leading performance in a variety of OOD experimental settings.
Note that previous representation learning based models (generally learning from correlations) are hard to generalize to OOD setting, and our model demonstrates that causal-based learning is a promising solution for this setting.

Since the causal model itself is the method which modes the process of data generation, the mined causal rule can be used to understand the physical  mechanism of knowledge graph generation. It opens up new possibilities for research in fields such as pharmaceutical economics.
Besides, although this paper propose a rule-based model which can works under OOD setting, how to improve the generalization ability of the representation-based models is still a open problem and deserved further investigation.
