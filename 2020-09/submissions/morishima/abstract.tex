Computational division of labor addresses the design and analysis of algorithms for division of labor problems and will be one of the key issues in Future of Work.
%algorithms for the problems of how to decompose and assign integrating AI and human labors to perform given tasks. 
The problems deal with interactions among multiple worker and task classes in task decomposition, worker recruitment and education, and task assignments to  AI and humans, for efficiently completing given tasks. We survey some  
of the related literature and discuss challenges and open problems.
