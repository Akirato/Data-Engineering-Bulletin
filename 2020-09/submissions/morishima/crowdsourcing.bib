They do so by asking humans to perform a task that computers cannot yet perform, such as deciphering distorted characters. Our research explored whether such human effort can be channeled into a useful purpose: helping to digitize old printed material by asking users to decipher scanned words from books that computerized optical character recognition failed to recognize. We showed that this method can transcribe text with a word accuracy exceeding 99\%, matching the guarantee of professional human transcribers. Our apparatus is deployed in more than 40,000 Web sites and has transcribed over 440 million words.},

A model is presented which allows individual error-rates to be estimated for polytomous facets even when the patient's "true" response is not available. The EM algorithm is shown to provide a slow but sure way of obtaining maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of interest. Some preliminary experience is reported and the limitations of the method are described.},

abstract="One of the fundamental issues in crowdsourcing is the trade-off between the number of workers needed for high-accuracy aggregation and the budget to pay. To save cost, it is important to ensure high quality of the crowd-sourced labels, hence the total cost on label collection will be reduced. Since the confidence of the workers often has a close relationship with their abilities, a possible way for quality control is to request the workers to return the labels only when they feel confident, by means of providing them with an `unsure' option. On the other hand, allowing workers to choose the unsure option can potentially waste part of the budget. In this work, we conduct an analysis towards understanding when providing the unsure option indeed leads to significant cost reduction, as well as how the confidence threshold might be set. We also propose an online mechanism, which is an alternative for threshold selection when the estimation of the crowd ability distribution is difficult.",

	abstract = {Learning from few examples and generalizing to dramatically different situations are capabilities of human visual intelligence that are yet to be matched by leading machine learning models. By drawing inspiration from systems neuroscience, we introduce a probabilistic generative model for vision in which message-passing based inference handles recognition, segmentation and reasoning in a unified way. The model demonstrates excellent generalization and occlusion-reasoning capabilities, and outperforms deep neural networks on a challenging scene text recognition benchmark while being 300-fold more data efficient. In addition, the model fundamentally breaks the defense of modern text-based CAPTCHAs by generatively segmenting characters without CAPTCHA-specific heuristics. Our model emphasizes aspects like data efficiency and compositionality that may be important in the path toward general artificial intelligence.},

It included a surprise in the opening, complex middle-game strategy and a deep ending. As the game headed for its mysterious finale, the World Team re-quested a KQQKQQ endgame table and was provided with two by the authors. This paper 
describes their work, compares the methods used, examines the issues raised and summarises the concepts involved for the benefit of future workers in the endgame field. It also notes the contribution of this endgame to chess itself.}

abstract="Spatial Crowdsourcing (SC) is a emerging outsourcing platform that allocates spatio-temporal tasks to a set of workers. However, it usually demands workers to upload their privacy information to untrustworthy entities, which causes a privacy breach. In this paper, we consider a complex SC scenario, in which each worker has a skill, whereas each spatial task requires a set of skills. Under this scenario, we propose a novel framework that can protect the location and skill privacy of workers while providing effective task assignment. Experimental results on both real and synthetic data sets show the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework.",
