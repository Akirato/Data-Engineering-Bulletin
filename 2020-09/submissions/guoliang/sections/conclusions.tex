\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:con}



In this paper,  we review existing studies in human-in-the-loop techniques for machine learning. We first discuss how to apply human-in-the-loop techniques to the ML pipeline including data extraction, data integration, data cleaning, labeling and ML training/inference. Then we introduce five commonly used techniques in this field, including quality improvement, cost reduction, latency reduction, active learning and weak supervision. Finally, we provide open challenges and opportunities. 

% For quality, we discuss the truth inference and task assignment techniques. For cost, we review the  pruning, task selection, answer deduction, and sampling, techniques. For latency, we survey the round-based and statistical model. Also we study many active learning strategies to select interesting examples and weak supervision(including data programming and fact extraction). Then we review how to apply these techniques to the ML pipeline including data extraction, data integration, data cleaning and labeling.
