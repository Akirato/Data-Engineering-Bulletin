The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis of our time that has significantly affected almost every single person on earth in just several months. Even worse, we do not know when it will slow down and how long it will last. Analogous to fighting the COVID-19 pandemic in the physical world, data scientists need to deal with the infodemic of COVID-19 data to discover useful insight in order to guide wise and informative decisions, where the COVID-19 infodemic refers to all (messy) data relevant to COVID-19. In this paper, we present \sys, an end-to-end data science system for monitoring and exploring COVID-19 data, which ranges from (task-driven) data preparation, (descriptive, diagnostic, and prescriptive) data analytics, user interactions through (linked) spatio-temporal data visualizations, and applications in different use cases.
