The June 2020 issue of the IEEE Data Engineering Bulletin is available at http://t.ly/g2hv

Around the time we published our last issue in March, the nation went into a lockdown. Life in the last 3 months has been unprecedented in many ways. Doctors, healthcare professionals, medical staff and researchers made heroic efforts and sacrifices to save lives. Globally, the data science community also sprang to action. It is the first time that data driven approaches are being used at such a large scale toward solving a common problem. In this special issue of the Data Engineering Bulletin edited by Joseph Gonzalez, we feature 9 papers on the topic of digital contact tracing, a technique that may prove crucial in the fight against Covid-19.

This issue also features two opinion pieces. Divyakant Agrawal and Amr El Abbadi’s wake-up call on managing data in an untrusted environment takes us to the fascinating world of cryptocurrencies and blockchains. The second opinion piece, written by Jeffrey D. Ullman, addresses a question on the mind of every database person: What is our role in the machine learning and AI revolution? Ullman’s perspective, illustrated by his remake of the well known Conway Venn Diagram is incisive, thought-provoking, and entertaining at the same time.
