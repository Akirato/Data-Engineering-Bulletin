The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with 10000 images. The test batch contains exactly 1000 randomly-selected images from each class. The training batches contain the remaining images in random order, but some training batches may contain more images from one class than another. Between them, the training batches contain exactly 5000 images from each class. },

abstract = {Fabric is a modular and extensible open-source system for deploying and operating permissioned blockchains and one of the Hyperledger projects hosted by the Linux Foundation (www.hyperledger.org).Fabric is the first truly extensible blockchain system for running distributed applications. It supports modular consensus protocols, which allows the system to be tailored to particular use cases and trust models. Fabric is also the first blockchain system that runs distributed applications written in standard, general-purpose programming languages, without systemic dependency on a native cryptocurrency. This stands in sharp contrast to existing block-chain platforms that require "smart-contracts" to be written in domain-specific languages or rely on a cryptocurrency. Fabric realizes the permissioned model using a portable notion of membership, which may be integrated with industry-standard identity management. To support such flexibility, Fabric introduces an entirely novel blockchain design and revamps the way blockchains cope with non-determinism, resource exhaustion, and performance attacks.This paper describes Fabric, its architecture, the rationale behind various design decisions, its most prominent implementation aspects, as well as its distributed application programming model. We further evaluate Fabric by implementing and benchmarking a Bitcoin-inspired digital currency. We show that Fabric achieves end-to-end throughput of more than 3500 transactions per second in certain popular deployment configurations, with sub-second latency, scaling well to over 100 peers.},

abstract = {Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a popular technique for large-scale optimization problems in machine learning. In order to parallelize SGD, minibatch training needs to be employed to reduce the communication cost. However, an increase in minibatch size typically decreases the rate of convergence. This paper introduces a technique based on approximate optimization of a conservatively regularized objective function within each minibatch. We prove that the convergence rate does not decrease with increasing minibatch size. Experiments demonstrate that with suitable implementations of approximate optimization, the resulting algorithm can outperform standard SGD in many scenarios.},

TITLE={Biological Robustness: Paradigms, Mechanisms, and Systems Principles},      
JOURNAL={Frontiers in Genetics},      
VOLUME={3},      
YEAR={2012},      
URL={https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fgene.2012.00067}, DOI={10.3389/fgene.2012.00067},      
ISSN={1664-8021},   
ABSTRACT={Robustness has been studied through the analysis of data sets, simulations, and a variety of experimental techniques that each have their own limitations but together confirm the ubiquity of biological robustness. Recent trends suggest that different types of perturbation (e.g., mutational, environmental) are commonly stabilized by similar mechanisms, and system sensitivities often display a long-tailed distribution with relatively few perturbations representing the majority of sensitivities. Conceptual paradigms from network theory, control theory, complexity science, and natural selection have been used to understand robustness, however each paradigm has a limited scope of applicability and there has been little discussion of the conditions that determine this scope or the relationships between paradigms. Systems properties such as modularity, bow-tie architectures, degeneracy, and other topological features are often positively associated with robust traits, however common underlying mechanisms are rarely mentioned. For instance, many system properties support robustness through functional redundancy or through response diversity with responses regulated by competitive exclusion and cooperative facilitation. Moreover, few studies compare and contrast alternative strategies for achieving robustness such as homeostasis, adaptive plasticity, environment shaping, and environment tracking. These strategies share similarities in their utilization of adaptive and self-organization processes that are not well appreciated yet might be suggestive of reusable building blocks for generating robust behavior.}

do with the help of a trusted party, they can also do by themselves. Fundamentally,
however, this notion depends on the honesty of at least some players. We put forward
and implement a stronger notion, Rational Secure Computation, that does not depend
on player honesty, but solely on player rationality. The key to our implementation
is showing that the ballotbox -the venerable device used throughout the world to tally
secret votes securely can actually be used to securely compute any function. Our work
bridges the fields of Game Theory and Cryptography, and has broad implications for
Mechanism Design.},

abstract = {Recent work has constructed economic mechanisms that are both truthful and differentially
private. In these mechanisms, privacy is treated separately from truthfulness; it
is not incorporated in players’ utility functions (and doing so has been shown to
lead to nontruthfulness in some cases). In this work, we propose a new, general way
of modeling privacy in players’ utility functions. Specifically, we only assume that
if an outcome o has the property that any report of player i would have led to o with
approximately the same probability, then o has a small privacy cost to player i. We
give three mechanisms that are truthful with respect to our modeling of privacy: for
an election between two candidates, for a discrete version of the facility location
problem, and for a general social choice problem with discrete utilities (via a VCG-like
mechanism). As the number n of players increases, the social welfare achieved by our
mechanisms approaches optimal (as a fraction of n).},

    abstract = { In the generalized assignment problem (gap), a set of jobs seek to be assigned to a set of machines. For every job-machine pair, there are a specific value and an accommodated capacity for the assignment. The objective is to find an assignment that maximizes the total sum of values given that the capacity constraint of every machine is satisfied. The gap is a classic optimization problem and has been studied extensively from the algorithmic perspective. Dughmi and Ghosh [Dughmi S, Ghosh A (2010) Truthful assignment without money. ACM Conf. Electronic Commerce (ACM, New York), 325–334.] proposed the game theoretical framework in which every job is owned by a selfish agent who aims to maximize the value of his own assignment. They gave a logarithmic approximation truthful in expectation mechanism and left open the problem whether there exists a truthful mechanism with a constant approximation factor. In this paper, we give an affirmative answer to this question and provide a constant approximation mechanism that enjoys a stronger incentive property of universal truthfulness than that of truthfulness in expectation. Our mechanism is inspired by stable matching, which is a fundamental solution concept in the context of matching marketplaces. The mechanism uses a stable matching algorithm as a critical component and adopts other approaches like random sampling. }

abstract= {The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. 

The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with 10000 images. The test batch contains exactly 1000 randomly-selected images from each class. The training batches contain the remaining images in random order, but some training batches may contain more images from one class than another. Between them, the training batches contain exactly 5000 images from each class. },

abstract = {Deep learning models for graphs have achieved strong performance for the task of node classification. Despite their proliferation, little is known about their robustness to adversarial attacks. Yet, in domains where they are likely to be used, e.g., the web, adversaries are common. Can deep learning models for graphs be easily fooled? In this work, we present a study of adversarial attacks on attributed graphs, specifically focusing on models exploiting ideas of graph convolutions. In addition to attacks at test time, we tackle the more challenging class of poisoning/causative attacks, which focus on the training phase of a machine learning model. We generate adversarial perturbations targeting the node’s features and the graph structure, thus, taking the dependencies between instances in account. Moreover, we ensure that the perturbations remain unnoticeable by preserving important data characteristics. To cope with the underlying discrete domain, we propose an efficient algorithm Nettack exploiting incremental computations. Our experimental study shows that accuracy of node classification significantly drops even when performing only few perturbations. Even more, our attacks are transferable: the learned attacks generalize to other state-of-the-art node classification models and unsupervised approaches, and likewise are successful even when only limited knowledge about the graph is given. For the first time, we successfully identify important patterns of adversarial attacks on graph neural networks (GNNs) — a first step towards being able to detect adversarial attacks on GNNs.},

  abstract = {Propelled by a fast evolving landscape of techniques and datasets, data science is growing rapidly. Against this background, topological data analysis (TDA) has carved itself a niche for the analysis of datasets that present complex interactions and rich structures. Its distinctive feature, topology, allows TDA to detect, quantify and compare the mesoscopic structures of data, while also providing a language able to encode interactions beyond networks. Here we briefly present the TDA paradigm and some applications, in order to highlight its relevance to the data science community.},

  abstract  = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer’s inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a stateof-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.82\% top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

OSG provides support for and evolution of the infrastructure through activities that cover operations, security, software, troubleshooting, addition of new capabilities, and support for existing and engagement with new communities. The OSG SciDAC-2 project provides specific activities to manage and evolve the distributed infrastructure and support it's use. The innovative aspects of the project are the maintenance and performance of a collaborative (shared \& common) petascale national facility over tens of autonomous computing sites, for many hundreds of users, transferring terabytes of data a day, executing tens of thousands of jobs a day, and providing robust and usable resources for scientific groups of all types and sizes. More information can be found at the OSG web site: www.opensciencegrid.org.}

	abstract = "Third-party architectures for data publishing over the Internet today are 
receiving growing attention, due to their scalability
properties and to the ability of efficiently managing large number of subjects and great amount of data. 
In a third-party architecture,
there is a distinction between the Owner and the Publisher of information. 
The Owner is the producer of information, whereas
Publishers are responsible for managing (a portion of) the Owner information and for answering subject queries. 
A relevant issue in this
architecture is how the Owner can ensure a secure and selective publishing of its data, 
even if the data are managed by a third-party,
which can prune some of the nodes of the original document on the basis of s
ubject queries and access control policies. An approach
can be that of requiring the Publisher to be trusted with regard to the considered security properties. 
However, the serious drawback of
this solution is that large Web-based systems cannot be easily verified to be secure and can be easily penetrated. 
For these reasons,
in this paper, we propose an alternative approach, based on the use of digital signature techniques, 
which does not require the
Publisher to be trusted. The security properties we consider are authenticity and completeness of a query response, 
where
completeness is intended with regard to the access control policies stated by the information Owner. 
In particular, we show that, by
embedding in the query response one digital signature generated by the Owner and some hash values, 
a subject is able to locally
verify the authenticity of a query response. 
Moreover, we present an approach that, for a wide range of queries, allows a subject to
verify the completeness of query results.",

 information access, and corpus-based computational linguistics, and
 then discuss the relationship of these to text data mining. The
 intent behind these contrasts is to draw attention to exciting new
 kinds of problems for computational linguists. I describe examples of
 what I consider to be real text data mining efforts and briefly
 outline our recent ideas about how to pursue exploratory data
 analysis over text."
