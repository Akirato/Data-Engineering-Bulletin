\begin{abstract}
With the prevalence of smart mobile devices empowered by considerable sensing capabilities, crowdsensing has become one promising way to sense urban phenomena (e.g., traffic and environment) at a large scale. In crowdsensing, a fundamental issue is discovering the truth from participants' noisy sensed data. Traditionally, participants need to upload their raw sensed data with locations for truth discovery, but this may leak participants' private information such as home and work locations. In this paper, we propose a federated truth discovery method that can learn the truth without collecting participants' sensed data and locations. Our method ensures that the obtained truth quality has no performance loss compared to the original truth discovery method if all the participants keep online; even if some participants lose connections unpredictably, our method can still learn the truth based on rest participants' data.
Meanwhile, as participants' sensed data are unknown to the server, it is hard for the crowdsensing organizer to justify each participant's sensing trustworthiness. This brings difficulties to crowdsensing management such as participant recruitment and incentive allocation. We further propose a federated ranking mechanism to generate a leader-board for participants' trustworthiness, which can also tolerate participants' connection loss. Both theoretical analysis and real-data empirical evaluations have been done to verify the effectiveness of FedTruthFinder.
