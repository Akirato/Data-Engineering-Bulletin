%\section{Future Work}
%
%As a pioneering attempt to solve the truth discovery problem in crowdsensing, our research still has certain limitations and points out some future opportunities.
%
%\textbf{Multi-class and Continuous-value Event Sensing}. In this work, we focus on binary event sensing. Naturally, our method can be extended to multi-class event sensing. Besides, sometimes we need to sense continuous value for a certain event (e.g., temperature). We will also study this in the future.
%
%%\textbf{Homomorphic Encryption-enabled Truth Discovery}. In FL systems, two widely adopted security mechanisms are homomorphic encryption (HE) and secure multi-party computation (SMC) \cite{yang2019federated}. Shamir's secret sharing is one type of SMC, which we rely on to build FedTruthFinder. HE may be another technical route to reach the goal. Currently, we do not choose HE because its computation efficiency is 10-100 times slower than non-HE computation. Some pioneering efforts have been devoted to developing privacy-preserving truth discovery systems with HE. Due to the large computation burden, these studies only let two non-colluding powerful servers to do HE computation instead of letting each client do computation in a federated (distributed) manner \cite{Tang2018NonInteractivePT,Zheng2018LearningTT}. However, finding two non-colluding servers are not so easy \cite{Bonawitz2017PracticalSA}.

%%Currently, we do not choose HE because its computation efficiency is 10-100 times slower than non-HE computation. Recently, HE tools have developed rapidly \cite{sealcrypto}, and we believe HE-enabled truth discovery is a promising direction. 
%
%\textbf{Other Truth Discovery Algorithms}. Besides the iterative truth discovery algorithm discussed in this paper, there are also other state-of-the-art truth discovery algorithms, such as optimization-based methods \cite{Li2014ACA,Li2015OnTD} and graphical model-based methods \cite{Pasternack2013LatentCA,Zhao2012ABA}. A comprehensive survey on truth discovery algorithms can be referred to \cite{li2016survey}. In the future, we will study whether our methods can be adapted to more truth discovery algorithms.
%
%\textbf{Against More Serious Attack Scenarios}. In this work, we assume that all the users are semi-honest, i.e., they will follow the protocol to compute and upload the corresponding data. In a more competitive setting, users can be malicious and upload some wrong data for attacking other users' privacy. We will discuss the solutions under such conditions in the future.
%
%\textbf{Missing Negative Sensed Data}. For some crowdsensing applications, users would only upload the positive sensed data ($e_j=1$). The truth discovery algorithms need to be refined as negative sensed data ($e_j=0$) are implicit. We will try to develop the federated version of such truth discovery algorithms in our future work.
%
%\textbf{Deployment on Smartphones}. In this work, we focus on the algorithmic design. In the future, we will implement the algorithm and deploy it to smartphones to further test its communication costs, energy consumption, etc. We will try to find practical guidelines to deploy such a federated crowdsensing truth discovery mechanism.

\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we propose \textit{FedTruthFinder}, a crowdsensing federated truth discovery mechanism that can not only find aggregate truth from multiple participants' sensed data, but also rank participants' trustworthiness in a privacy-preserving manner. The primary characteristic of FedTruthFinder is its capability to tolerate network connection loss of participants in both event confidence calculation and participant trustworthiness ranking. As a byproduct, our proposed federated ranking algorithm can also serve other applications when the privacy-preserving data ranking is needed and the network connections are unstable.
Following most related papers, this work assumes participants to be semi-honest; in the future, we would explore the more challenging scenario that participants may behave maliciously.%To the best of our knowledge, FedTruthFinder is the best privacy-preserving truth discovery mechanism for crowdsensing regarding the robustness against participants' unpredictable connection loss.
