\section{Conclusions}
In this paper, we present the vision of our \DualChain{} system, which facilitates 
the creation of a safe and efficient decentralized economy. \DualChain{} achieves these 
guarantees by separating the life-cycle of a client transaction into two phases: 
commitment and settlement. In the commitment phase, \DualChain{} employs a 
traditional \BFT{} protocol to order the client transactions. Post this, \DualChain{} 
requires a set of miners to run the settlement phase, where they notarize the ordered 
client transactions. Our \DualChain{} architecture does not impact the transaction 
latency observed by the client as each client receives the commitment response post 
\BFT{} consensus. Further, to efficiently notarize transactions during the settlement 
phase, our \DualChain{} architecture introduces the notion of collaborative mining, 
where participants work together instead of competing with each other. These notarized 
transactions are written to a ledger and can be queried in the future.
