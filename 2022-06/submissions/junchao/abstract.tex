The recent surge in blockchain applications has accelerated the research in 
designing efficient decentralized currencies. Building a decentralized economy 
on the traditional byzantine fault-tolerant (\BFT{}) protocols or the Proof-of-Work 
(\PoW{}) consensus protocol is inadequate as the immutability of the ledger created 
by the former is at the mercy of the long-term safe-keeping of private keys of 
participants, while the latter yields an extremely inefficient and environmentally 
unsustainable consensus. To ameliorate this situation, we envision the design of 
our \DualChain{} architecture, which offers the best of both worlds. Our \DualChain{} 
design runs a traditional \BFT{} protocol to commit client transactions and employs 
our novel Power-of-Collaboration (\PoC{}) protocol to notarize the \BFT{} chain. 
Unlike \PoW{}, our \PoC{} protocol advocates for participants to work together 
collaboratively instead of competing (often selfishly), which results in a 
safe, high-throughput, and resource-efficient consensus design.
