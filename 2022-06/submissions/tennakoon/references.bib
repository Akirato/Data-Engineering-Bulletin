abstract = {This paper presents Basil, the first transactional, leaderless Byzantine Fault Tolerant key-value store. Basil leverages ACID transactions to scalably implement the abstraction of a trusted shared log in the presence of Byzantine actors. Unlike traditional BFT approaches, Basil executes non-conflicting operations in parallel and commits transactions in a single round-trip during fault-free executions. Basil improves throughput over traditional BFT systems by four to five times, and is only four times slower than TAPIR, a non-Byzantine replicated system. Basil's novel recovery mechanism further minimizes the impact of failures: with 30% Byzantine clients, throughput drops by less than 25% in the worst-case.},

abstract = {Blockchain, known as distributed ledger technology, suffers from the scalability problem. A major approach to overcoming this limitation is using sharding, which divides the network into multiple smaller groups, called shards, these shards can work in parallel on disjoint transactions and maintain disjoint ledgers. Existing sharding-based protocols rely on reshuffling scheme to maintain security, however, since each shard only maintains a disjoint ledger, reshuffling the network will cause huge data migration. In this work, we propose SSChain, a novel non-reshuffling structure that supports both transaction sharding and state sharding. Our empirical evaluations suggest that SSChain can process more than 6,500 TPS in a network of 1,800 nodes without any data migration overhead.}

abstract = {Scalability is one of the main roadblocks to business adoption of blockchain systems. Despite recent intensive research on using sharding techniques to enhance the scalability of blockchain systems, existing solutions do not efficiently address cross-shard transactions. In this paper, we introduce SharPer, a scalable permissioned blockchain system. In SharPer, nodes are clustered and each data shard is replicated on the nodes of a cluster. SharPer supports networks consisting of either crash-only or Byzantine nodes. In SharPer, the blockchain ledger is formed as a directed acyclic graph and each cluster maintains only a view of the ledger. SharPer incorporates decentralized flattened protocols to establish cross-shard consensus. The decentralized nature of the cross-shard consensus in SharPer enables parallel processing of transactions with nonoverlapping clusters. Furthermore, SharPer provides deterministic safety guarantees. The experimental results reveal the efficiency of SharPer in terms of performance and scalability especially in workloads with a low percentage of cross-shard transactions.},
