An overview of Vizier's architecture is shown in \Cref{fig:vizier-architecture}.
Addressing requirement \textbf{W1}, the central abstraction in Vizier is a workflow: a linear sequence of steps. % taken by the user in pursuit of a specific objective.
Unlike classical workflow systems, Vizier does not require users to explicitly declare information flow between steps.
Rather Vizier borrows the model employed in popular computational notebooks like Jupyter, where inter-cell communication occurs through a global state (artifacts) passed sequentially through steps.
Following notebook conventions, we refer to these steps as \emph{cells}, and the global state as a \emph{scope}, a map from artifact name to the version of the artifact valid at this point in the workflow. Vizier stores artifacts in common formats through a versioned \textbf{Artifact Store} (\Cref{sec:data-artifacts}), addressing requirement \textbf{A2}.
In \Cref{sec:vizier-workflows}, we formalize Vizier's workflow model, and show how we satisfy requirement \textbf{W3} by instrumenting how each cell interacts with the scope, allowing us to determine what artifact versions are valid.

Vizier's workflow semantics, paired with the versioned artifact store and workflow versioning (\Cref{sec:vizier-history}) addresses requirement \textbf{W2}. % as notebooks have a natural concept of logical order (the order of cells in the notebook) that can be adjusted over time.
% Adding workflow versioning  is sufficient to fully address the requirement.
In contrast, classical notebooks like Jupyter or Zeppelin rely on the global state of an interpreter for inter-cell communication.
Reverting this state to an earlier revision is challenging~\cite{zelnicki:2017:nodebook}, limiting their ability to satisfy requirement \textbf{W3}.
Vizier instead relies on its versioning system, allowing its \textbf{Scheduler} to automatically detect and re-evaluate stale cells (\Cref{sec:vizier-scheduler}).
To address requirement \textbf{A3}, we designed a light-weight uncertain data model that is implemented in Vizier in the form of \textit{caveats}, annotations on data that indicate uncertain values and rows  (\Cref{sec:data-docum-error}).

Addressing requirement \textbf{A1} requires modularity in both Vizier's front- and back-end components.
First, the user's interactions with a workflow and artifacts, whether through a scripting language, graphical interaction, or any other modality, need to be captured for replay (simultaneously addressing requirement \textbf{A4}). In Vizier this is achieved by requiring that every update to an artifact made through a particular modality has to be reflected as an operation in the workflow, i.e., a data update is translated into a workflow update.
Vizier manages a collection of \textbf{Command Implementations} that implement the logic behind these artifact transformations (\Cref{sec:multimodality}).
To streamline the implementation of commands, Vizier's data formats and transformations are built over standard \textbf{Data Processing Backends} like Apache Spark.
% For example, Vizier supports fine-grained provenance over datasets by encoding them as Spark data frames.

The frontend is implemented over a \textbf{Workflow Mirror} that uses websockets to reflect a live view of the workflow the user is editing.
Vizier automatically derives a default \textbf{Artifact Manipulation User Interface} for its notebook interface from each command's parameter schemas. This interface suffices for many templated commands, but the frontend can be further extended to provide a more customized experience, for example for Spreadsheet-style direct manipulation of data (\Cref{sec:spreadsheets}).
As illustrated in \Cref{fig:screenshot}, the frontend displays three \textbf{Workflow Interaction User Interfaces} by default: (i) A direct display of the workflow as a notebook, (ii) a table of contents summary of the notebook, including highlighting from documentation, and (iii) a list of artifacts derived by the notebook.
Several of these components, including the notebook and the artifact list provide access to direct manipulation interfaces.
Additional views currently implemented in Vizier include: (iv) A caveat view (\Cref{sec:data-docum-error}) that shows and tracks potential errors in the workflow and data, (v) a history view that shows the evolution of the workflow over time, and (vi) a data provenance subway diagram view.
